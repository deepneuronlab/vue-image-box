# Draws an area on top of an Image

This project uses Vue.js and Vue-Router.

In the `data` folder, there are `PNG images`, each images has an `XML` file associated with it. 
In the `PdfPage.vue` file, the `XML` file is parsed.


## ToDo:
- Add an editable `label` for each area.
- Improve the strcucture and data flow.
